Started adding Snippets to a TextMate Bundle.
=====================================================

TextMate is editor for Mac. Here are some Tab completions.

form.c = {{ form.create('$1'$2) }}$3
form.i = {{ form.input('$1', ['label': '$2'|trans$3]) }}
form.e = {{ form.end($1) }}$2
html.a = {{ html.link('$1'|trans, ['controller':'$2']) }}  
... and so on 

Fast and simple. I think some editors on windows support
bundles aswell.. anyway. wrote this mainly for myself.
Will release my bundle at some point.
